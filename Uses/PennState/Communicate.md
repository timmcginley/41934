## Description
One of the primary Uses of BIM is to communicate facility information. The communication purpose of BIM is intended to present information about a facility in a method which can be shared or exchanged. This is often the last step of many other processes when a visualization, transformation, drawing, or document is developed to communicate information from that process to the next user of that information. This is one of the most valuable uses of BIM. It promotes and enhances communication and often reduces the time it takes to communicate. Additionally, communication of the data is often a byproduct of the processes to accomplish other BIM Uses.
