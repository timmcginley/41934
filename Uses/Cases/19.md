![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d7d1bd9-97fa-44bf-9505-43dc3e0e861e)

## Description
A process in which the functionality of the building structure (walls, floors, roof, etc) and equipment serving the building (mechanical, electrical, plumbing, etc) are maintained over the operational life of a facility. A successful maintenance program will improve building performance, reduce repairs, and reduce overall maintenance costs.

## Potential Value
-	Plan maintenance activities proactively and appropriately allocate maintenance staff
-	Track maintenance history
-	Reduce corrective maintenance and emergency maintenance repairs
-	Increase productivity of maintenance staff because the physical location of equipment/system is clearly understood
-	Evaluate different maintenance approaches based on cost
-	Allow facility managers to justify the need and cost of establishing a reliability centered maintenance program

## Resources Required
-	Design review software to view Record ModelÂ and components
-	Building Automation System (BAS) linked to Record Model
-	User-Friendly Dashboard Interface linked to Record Model to provide building performance information and/or other information to educate building users

## Team Competencies Required
-	Ability to understand and manipulate CMMSÂ and building control systems with Record Model
-	Ability to understand typical equipment operation and maintenance practices
-	Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D Model
