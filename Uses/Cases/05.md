![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38ddea48-aa4d-4e8b-b9b3-d648c353e27b)

## Description
Using BIM and/or Geographic Information System (GIS) to evaluate sites within a given area to determine the optimal site location for a future project. The site data collected is used to first select the site and then position the building and infrastructure based on other criteria.
 
## Potential Value
-	Use calculated decision making to determine if potential sites meet the required criteria according to project requirements, technical factors, and financial factors
-	Decrease costs of utility demand and demolition
-	Increase energy efficiency
-	Minimize risk of hazardous material
-	Maximize return on investment
 
## Resources Required
-	GIS and/or BIM Authoring software
-	3D Model manipulation
 
## Team Competencies Required
-	Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D model
-	Knowledge and understanding of local authority's system (GIS, database information)
