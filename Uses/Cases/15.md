![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/761276f3-f76d-4fd3-9f2e-bd61cce7f245)

## Description
Using 3D System Design Software to design and analyze the construction of a complex building system (e.g., form work, glazing, support of excavation, etc.) to increase planning.
 
## Potential Value
-	Increase constructability of a complex building system
-	Increase construction productivity
-	Increase safety awareness of a complex building system
-	Decrease language barriers
 
## Resources Required
-	3D System design software
 
## Team Competencies Required
-	Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review 3D model
-	Ability to make appropriate construction decisions using a 3D System Design Software
-	Knowledge of typical and appropriate construction practices for each component
