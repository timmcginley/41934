Design Authoring is a process of using BIM authoring software and tools to create and develop an Information Model of the project progressively to support selected BIM Uses before project milestones which includes a database of properties, quantities, means and methods, costs and schedules. The architect, engineer, surveyor, consultant, contractor, sub-consultant and sub-contractor shall use the BIM authoring software and tools to develop their designs and produce views and drawings including but not limited to 3D perspective, layout plan, elevation, section, detail, fabrication and shop drawings. The software and tools are also used to produce schedules (room, door, window, finishes, and panel for distribution board, etc.). The same principle applies to all types of projects and disciplines. ​

## Description
A process in which 3D software is used to develop a Building Information Model based on criteria that is important to the translation of the building's design. Authoring tools create models while audit and analysis tools study or add to the richness of information in a model. Most of audit and analysis tools can be used for Design Review and Engineering AnalysisÂ BIM Uses. Design authoring tools are a first step towards BIM and the key is connecting the 3D model with a powerful database of properties, quantities, means and methods, costs and schedules.
