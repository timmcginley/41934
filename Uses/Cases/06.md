Design Authoring is a process of using BIM authoring software and tools to create and develop an Information Model of the project progressively to support selected BIM Uses before project milestones which includes a database of properties, quantities, means and methods, costs and schedules. The architect, engineer, surveyor, consultant, contractor, sub-consultant and sub-contractor shall use the BIM authoring software and tools to develop their designs and produce views and drawings including but not limited to 3D perspective, layout plan, elevation, section, detail, fabrication and shop drawings. The software and tools are also used to produce schedules (room, door, window, finishes, and panel for distribution board, etc.). The same principle applies to all types of projects and disciplines. ​

## Description
A process in which 3D software is used to develop a Building Information Model based on criteria that is important to the translation of the building's design. Authoring tools create models while audit and analysis tools study or add to the richness of information in a model. Most of audit and analysis tools can be used for Design Review and Engineering AnalysisÂ BIM Uses. Design authoring tools are a first step towards BIM and the key is connecting the 3D model with a powerful database of properties, quantities, means and methods, costs and schedules.
 
## Potential Value

-	Improved quality control and assurance

## Resources Required
-	Design Authoring Software
 
## Team Competencies Required
-	Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D model
-	Knowledge of construction means and methods
-	Design and construction experience

## Extensions - Drawing Generation (Drawing Production)
It includes Drawing Generation is a process of using BIM to produce 2D drawings, which shall be adopted in both design stage and construction stage. ​​As far as practicable, all 2D drawings shall be generated from the BIM authoring software and tools directly. Approval shall be sought from the Appointing Party / Client for the exemption of producing any drawings from BIM. 
A registration list showing the relationship between the Information Models and 2D drawings shall be created to indicate whether each 2D drawing is generated from the BIM or not. Any 2D drawings which are produced from non-BIM authoring software or tools shall be prepared in accordance with the standards for 2D drawings as specified in the contract documents. In case any drawing is not created natively in the BIM authoring software it should be linked to the Information Models.
