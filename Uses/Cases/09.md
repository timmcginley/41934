## Description
A process in which analytical modeling software utilizes the BIM design authoring model so to determine the behavior of a given lighting system. This can also include artificial (indoor and outdoor) and natural (daylighting and solar shading) lighting. Based on this analysis further development and refinement of the lighting design takes place to create effective, efficient, and constructible lighting systems. The application of this analysis tool allows for performance simulations that can significantly improve the design, and performance of the facility's lighting over its lifecycle.
