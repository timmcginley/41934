![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a505432a-9c1a-48da-8c7c-007c49b9cbe4)

## Description
A process in which 3D coordination software is used to determine identify 3D geometric conflicts by comparing 3D models of building systems. The goal of 3D coordination is to eliminate field conflicts and coordination issues prior to installation.

## Potential Value
-	Coordinate building project through a model
-	Reduce and eliminate field conflicts; which reduces RFI's significantly compared to other methods
-	Visualize construction
-	Increase productivity
-	Reduced construction cost; potentially less cost growth (i.e. less change orders)
-	Decrease construction time
-	Increase productivity on site
-	More accurate as built drawings

## Resources Required
-	Design Authoring Software
-	Model Review Software

## Team Competencies Required
-	Ability to deal with people and project challenges
-	Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D model
-	Knowledge of BIM model applications for facility updates
-	Knowledge of building systems
