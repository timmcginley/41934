# 16: Digital Fabrication
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/362abfea-1850-4cfc-8717-1e4405caca4b)

## Description
A process that uses digitized information to facilitate the fabrication of construction materials or assemblies. Some uses of digital fabrication can be seen in sheet metal fabrication, structural steel fabrication, pipe cutting, prototyping for design intent reviews etc. It assists in ensuring that the downstream phase of manufacturing has minimum ambiguities and enough information to fabricate with minimal waste. An information model could also be used with suitable technologies to assemble the fabricated parts into the final assembly.
