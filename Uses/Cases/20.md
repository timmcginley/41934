![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21f5cc36-b604-491b-ae78-f699ed410c7f)

## Description
A process that measures how a building's performance compares to the specified design. This includes how the mechanical system operates and how much energy a building uses. Other aspects of this analysis include, but are not limited to, ventilated facade studies, lighting analysis, internal and external CFD airflow, and solar analysis.

## Potential Value
-	Ensure building is operating to specified design and sustainable standards
-	Identify opportunities to modify system operations to improve performance
-	Create a "what if" scenario and change different materials throughout the building to show better or worse performance conditions

## Resources Required
-	Building Systems Analysis Software (Energy, Lighting, Mechanical, Other)

## Team Competencies Required
-	Ability to understand and manipulate CMMS and building control systems with Record Model
-	Ability to understand typical equipment operation and maintenance practices
-	Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D Model
