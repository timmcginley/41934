![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69331592-b17d-4d71-9703-603234779002)

## Description
A process in which a 4D model (3D models with the added dimension of time) is utilized to effectively plan the phased occupancy in a renovation, retrofit, addition, or to show the construction sequence and space requirements on a building site. 4D modeling is a powerful visualization and communication tool that can give a project team the including owner a better understanding of project milestones and construction plans.

## Potential Value
-	Better understanding of the phasing schedule by the owner and project participants and showing the critical path of the project
-	Dynamic phasing plans of occupancy offering multiple options and solutions to space conflicts
-	Integrate planning of human, equipment and material resources with the BIM model to better schedule and cost estimate the project
-	Space and workspace conflicts identified and resolved ahead of the construction process
-	Marketing purposes and publicity
-	Identification of schedule, sequencing or phasing issues
-	More readily constructible, operable and maintainable project
-	Monitor procurement status of project materials
-	Increased productivity and decreased waste on job sites
-	Conveying the spatial complexities of the project, planning information, and support conducting additional analyses

## Resources Required
-	Design Authoring Software
-	Scheduling software
-	4D Modelling Software
 
## Team Competencies Required
-	Knowledge of construction scheduling and general construction process.Â  A 4D model is connected to a schedule, and is therefore only as good as the schedule to which it is linked.
-	Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D model.
-	Knowledge of 4D software: import geometry, manage links to schedules, produce and control animations, etc.
