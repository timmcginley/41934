# Speckle

Speckle solves the problem of File based collaboration, by replacing files with streams that can be accessed from the Web. Furthermore it enables the streamed data to be connected to most major BIM software. In this way it can translate native BIM data between software.

## Future
The metaphor of Stream to project is a bit limited, perhaps a stream could be different building systems instead.
