### IdS [Information Delivery Specification](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/projects/information-delivery-specification-ids/)

*A computer interpretable document that defines the Exchange Requirements of model based exchange.*

The Information Delivery Specification defines how objects, classifications, properties, and even values and units need to be delivered and exchanged. This can be a combination of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), Domain Extensions, and additional classifications and properties (national agreements or company specific ones; either stored in bSDD or somewhere else). This is the standard to use to define your Level of Information Needs. It brings validation of IFC to the client, the modeler and the Software Tools that perform (automated) analyses. It is a core component that can be used as a contract to deliver the correct information. It holds the ability to create localized and use-case specific requirements for your projects and asset portfolio. The IDS is the solution for predictable and reliable data exchange workflows.
