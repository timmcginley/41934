# Classification

>Classification systems attempt to solve the problem of non standard entity descriptions. They enable different countries and regions to have their own names for objects.

## Challenges / Issues
Managing the challenges of classification systems is a key component of the [manager] role in OpenBIM.
* Conversion between Classification systems.
* Model Classification completeness checking.
* Selecting the correct descrition with certainty.
* Choosing which classification system to specify for your project.
* knowing if an entity exists in a system.
* Where to put entities that *don't really fit*.

## Advanced Classification Problems
* Automated Classification. Use of Machine Learning to support the automated classification of building information models.

## Examples
* [Blender Classification]
* [IfcOpenShell Classification]
