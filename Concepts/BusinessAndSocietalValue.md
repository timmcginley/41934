# Business and Societal Value

The purpose of the course is to help you to extract information from building information models.

We follow open approaches to this because they are of benefit to society because they reduce the barriers to designing and engineering better buildings.

This is great but we also want you to be aware of the business value of your tool or process you are developing.

As an employee or freelance OpenBIM Guru, someone is paying your time to get information that has valuable to them. Its that simple. Please remain focussed on both the societal and business value of your work :)
