### IDM [Information Delivery Manual](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/information-delivery-manual/)

*A methodology for defining and documenting business processes and data requirements*

The built asset industry is characterized by bringing many different stakeholders together in a project-specific organization. In order to work efficiently, it is necessary for all participants to know which and when different kinds of information have to be communicated. The **ISO 29481-1:2010** “Building Information Modelling - Information Delivery Manual - Part 1: Methodology and Format” standard has been developed by buildingSMART in order to have a methodology to capture and specify processes and information flow during the lifecycle of a facility.

This session makes a link between ISO 19650 and IDM.
