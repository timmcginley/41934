# BIM Dimensions

BIM is a multidimensional approach to digital construction management that encompasses dimensions that refer to different aspects of a building model and how information is stored, managed, and visualized within the BIM software. The dimensions of BIM typically include:​

## 3D - Virtual walkthrough and project visualization, clash detection, 3D electronic and prefabricated models of elements.​
Objects are modeled in 3D with embedded information for the project. In other words, the model is not just a 3D representation of objects, but it also provides all the necessary information for preparing project documentation. The model serves as a source of information for generating drawing documentation, reports, material combinations, etc. The modeled objects are parametric, and any changes in the model affect the generated drawings or reports.​

## 4D - Construction planning and integration with the construction schedule.​
A 3D model with information about the time and sequence of installation for specific object elements. Construction, manufacturing, assembly and delivery time for construction can also be specified. Through the time-based information in the model, it is possible to create a simulation of the construction process.​

## 5D - Quantity extraction for budgeting assistance and real-time cost estimates depending on workflow.​
A 3D BIM model with information about the installation time of specific elements and their cost. Based on this information, a cost analysis of the construction project is conducted.​
​
## 6D - Energy analysis of building consumption and performance.​
A 3D model with additional information that analyzes the construction's impact on the environment and people. This data can be used for energy analysis of installations and determination of the carbon footprint.​

## 7D - Management of building operations and facilities.​
An expanded 3D model with the necessary information for the management and operation of the construction project. The model is often used as a basis for specialized Facility Management (FM) platforms and other concepts like the Internet of Things (IoT).
