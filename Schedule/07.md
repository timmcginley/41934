With scissors and tape you combine each groups BPMN diagrams into one super diagram.

1. first for the subject
2. then bring two subjects together.
3. Then bring them all together into one.

Each Manager group builds a new BPMN based on this which combine to make a single BPMN diagram.

Consider which resources we need. How can we call these efficiently?

How could we use this to compare different building options?

This will be the system we use in Advanced Building Design next semester.
