# W7: Voxels

*21st October 2024*

Presentation - In person demo from Thomas Krijnen.

1. ___ Check out the [Voxels](/Concepts/Voxel) resource.

## Questions arrising from the session

### Q. Distinguishing between LayerSet and ConstinuentSet
* A. Use a Data type ... Data is typically handled expolratory, maybe not only materials maybe layers ,could also be a problem about openings. Could aslo be affected by geometric representation. Don't worry too much about it being complete, trying to avoid corner cases, If statement would aslo work
the test a would be .is_a. 

### Q. Calculate glazing area without including the overlapping
* A. Could use voxelisation to get the external face. Typically in voxelisation would use 5cm voxels, but detail might be smaller. Really detailed models could complicate it. If you really look at the geometry it might be that thye are connected. Maybe you are in a sitaution that you don't know if it is really at the exterior. [ADD Voxelisation to calculate external surface etc].
