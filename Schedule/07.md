# W7: Voxels

*21st October 2024*

Presentation - In person demo from Thomas Krijnen.

1. ___ Check out the [Voxels](/Concepts/Voxel) resource.

## Questions arrising from the session

### Q. Distinguishing between LayerSet and ConstinuentSet
* A. Use a Data type ... Data is typically handled expolratory, maybe not only materials maybe layers ,could also be a problem about openings. Could aslo be affected by geometric representation. Don't worry too much about it being complete, trying to avoid corner cases, If statement would aslo work
the test a would be .is_a. 

### Q. Calculate glazing area without including the overlapping
* A. Could use voxelisation to get the external face. Typically in voxelisation would use 5cm voxels, but detail might be smaller.
* Computational complexity increases cubicly with size of voxels, so we don't want big voxels, perhaps you could hve develop levels of detail. Buildings are relatively similar sized, so 5 cm is a safe compromise between detail and performance - roughly equal to 30mins.
* Really detailed models could complicate it. If you really look at the geometry it might be that thye are connected. Maybe you are in a sitaution that you don't know if it is really at the exterior. [ADD Voxelisation to calculate external surface etc].

### Q. Installation
* A. IfcOpenShell - should install ok, the voxelisation toolkit Thomas will provide installation instructions.

### Q. Total list of functions
* A. IfcOpenShell is opensource. Thomas sees it as a map in an ecosystem of tools. depends on use case. If we want to do 2D it might be python... if 3d it might be something else... Maybe examples can be foudn on IfcOpenShell Academy - working through examples rather than full documentation. Maybe Dion, working mostly on Bonsai. He has done a great job on the higher level libraries - functional building blocks - can we get the links?

### Q. Structure of the different entities how much is it the same across different entities
* A. IFC provides a taxonomy of building parts and relationships. Not designed so that it can be viewed by different domain experts. 99% of cases interested problem will be the extrusion. Use IfcOpenShell to evaluate the object into a generic geometry representation. 1) inspect data graph
* 2) inspect geometry. Provide example of getting the geometric properties of a column, beam and slab. 3rd option is to look at property sets and hope we get the information you want. We could also use IDS to make sure that we get that data in the models we produce.
