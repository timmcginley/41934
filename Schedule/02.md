## Scripting IfcOpenShell in Blender
* This exercise works best wiht the architecture model as we will be trying to find the spaces in the model.
* From the top menu bar of Blender click the scripting tab
* Before you can start scripting you need to make a new script from the tab in the scripting window
* We know some of you are a little nervous about programming, but when we start we only need to know 2 things - copy and paste :)
* You are now workgin in Python, the first thing we need to do is imnport the python library we are wokring with in this course - [ifcOpenShell]
* Next we get the current model from blender BIM.
* To do this copy and paste the code below into your Blender Scriping window:

```python
import ifcopenshell
from blenderbim.bim.ifc import IfcStore
```

Now you can add get the IFC file that is active in your Blender environment with:
```python
file = IfcStore.get_file()
```
Cool now we can access the IFC file :)

You can get all the spaces in your file by:
```python
spaces = file.by_type('IfcSpace')
```
Now check how many spaces you have...
```python
print(len(spaces))
```
or print their names...
```python
for space in spaces:
	print(space.LongName)
```
You can have a look at [this](https://docs.ifcopenshell.org/ifcopenshell-python/hello_world.html) IfcOpenShell crash course for more examples. What other information can you find out about the model?


### 1) Get Githubbing
* you can get (if you don't have one already) a Github account for your group (this can be your normal account) and create a repository for the course, so it will be ready for you to add scripts to in the following weeks.

### 2) Analyst...

### 3) Manager...
