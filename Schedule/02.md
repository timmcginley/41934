# W2: IfcOpenShell

*9th September 2024*

## Part 1: Python in Blender
This builds on the work you did last week exploring IFC models in Blender. This time you will be using the Bonsai extension, to leverage Python and the ifcOpenShell library  to write simple scripts to query the IFC model.

### Presentation
* ___ Course News
* ___ IFC [Properties and PropertySets]
* ___ [Python] and tutorials
* ___ [IfcOpenShell Concept]
* ___ [Bonsai]

### Activity 1
[](/Activities/BlenderScriptIntro)
- [IfcOpenShell Examples]
- [Basic IfCopenshell Examples]
- [Intermediate IfCopenshell Examples]
- [Advanced IfCopenshell Examples]


## Part 2: Git and Github
In this part we introduce you to essential skill of working with Git, in this case in the environment of Github.
* you can get (if you don't have one already) a Github account for your group (this can be your normal account) and create a repository for the course, so it will be ready for you to add scripts to in the following weeks.

### Presentation 
* ___ Digital literacy at DTU - repos.
* ___ Functions
* ___ Libraries
* ___ [Git] and [Github]


### Activity 2
- [Git Introduction]

## Part 3: Writing our own tools
In this part we will experience developing as a class a distributed application for each of the focus area. Analysts will write functions and commit them to github. The managers will then include the analyst code as a library in their manager programme.

### Presentation
* ___ [Managers]
* ___ [Analysts]
* ___ Making your own Python libraries
* ___ [Git] Submodules ([Managers])

### Activity 3
- [Scripting with Ifcopenshell in System Environment]
