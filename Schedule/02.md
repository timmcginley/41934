## Scripting IfcOpenShell in Blender
To set up the scripting environment, make a new Blender window and switch to Python console mode. Once you have done that,Â import the libraries by typing:

```python
import ifcopenshell
from blenderbim.bim.ifc import IfcStore
```

Now you can add get the IFC file that is active in your Blender environment with:
```python
file = IfcStore.get_file()
```
Cool now we can access the IFC file :)

You can get all the spaces in your file by:
```python
spaces = file.by_type('IfcSpace')
```
Now check how many spaces you have...
```python
len(spaces)
```
or print their names...
```python
for space in spaces:
	print(space.LongName)
```
You can have a look at [this](https://docs.ifcopenshell.org/ifcopenshell-python/hello_world.html) IfcOpenShell crash course for more examples. What other information can you find out about the model?


### 1) Get Githubbing
* you can get (if you don't have one already) a Github account for your group (this can be your normal account) and create a repository for the course, so it will be ready for you to add scripts to in the following weeks.
