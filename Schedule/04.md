# W4: IDS

*23rd September 2024*

Introduction to [A2]

### Presentations

Jan Karlshøj will deliver a session on [IDS] and the PM use cases.

1. ___ What is Information Delivery Specification (IDS)]
1. ___ What is Virtual Design and Construction [(VDC)](/Concepts/VDC)?

### Activity
* Select the file for the discipline you want to work with based on your [focus area].
* Complete the IDS example exercise.
* Complete the BPMN example exercise (This will help you with [A2])

### Skills for A2 (Use Case)
2. ___ Introduction to [MarkDown](/Concepts/MarkDown)
1. ___ Introduction to [BPMN](/Concepts/BPMN)

### OpenBIM Standards
3. ___ Introduction to [UCM](/Concepts/UCM)

### BPMN Example exercise
We will hand out some example use cases.
Discuss in your groups the following based on the use case you have.
* Who is the use case for?
* What stage would the use case happen at?
* What stage in Advanced Building Design would this be?
* What disciplinary (non BIM) expertise would you need to use to solve the use case?
* What IFC concepts would be needed in this use case?
* What disciplinary analysis does it require?	
* What building elements are you interested in?
* What are the IFC names for these elements?
* What properties and attributes would you need to
* What disciplinary analysis would be required to complete this use case?

**Move to the foyer in building 127***
 
* What is the _input data_ for your use case?	
* What (use cases) need to be done _before_ you can start your use case?
* What (use cases) are waiting for your use case to complete?

To complete the exercise we need to log our new 'master process' that connects all the different use cases'. You can then use this as a skeleton to add your own use case to.
