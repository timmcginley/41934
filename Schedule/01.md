# W1: Open BIM

*2nd September 2024*

With Kristoffer Negendahl.

### Presentation

Please watch the introduction video which provides an introduction to:
* ___ What is (good) [BIM]?
* ___ What is the focus of the course?
* ___ How does it link to your own studies and specialisations?
* ___ What are the Benefits and challenges of [BIM]? (Inc. Silos)
* ___ Course [Assignments](/Assignments/index) and Feedback [ ]
* ___ [Assignment 1] Introduction

## Activity 1
* ___ How does it link to your own studies and specialisations?

### a) Choose a [focus] area / subject.
* In this activity you need to choose one of the focus areas.
* Pick up your things.
* Go now to the area allocated to your focus area:
  *   [Architecture] (Front left desks of room)
  *   [Indoor] (Front right desks of room)
  *   [Structure] (middle desks)
  *   [Materials / LCA] (back left desks of room)
  *   [Build] (back right desks of room)
* Once setlled in your focus area, subdivide into small groups of 2-3 people, this will be you group for the course.

### b) [focus] area groups elect a focus area manager group.
* Groups that wish to be managers for that focus area pitch to the rest of the focus group, each group votes, winning group is the manager.

### c) What building elements does your [focus] area analyse and design?
* Focus groups identify which elements of a building are most relevant to their focus area. Manager group records the elements that their groups suggest, if all groups agreet.
* Manager groups report back to the class.

### IFC Introduction lecture
* ___ What is OpenBIM?
* ___ [BIM Maturity Levels] [-]
* ___ [FAIR] Principles [ ]
* ___ [Interoperability] Principles [ ]
* ___ [Standards], Technical Specifications and Guides [ ]
* ___ What is [(Open)BIM] and what are what are [FOSS] tools and FAIR data?  [ ]
* ___ Course Rules
* ___ Circular Education System

### Activity 2

### 2) Download the model for your focus area
* ___ Download either:
   * ___ [Skylab IFC models](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/d2l/le/lessons/215344/folders/813833) *[enrolled students only]*.
   *  [CES_BLD_24_96](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/d2l/le/lessons/215344/folders/857237) *[enrolled students only]*.
* ___ decide which model you would like to focus on based on your focus area.

### 3) Download Blender / Bonsai (fka installation) and investigate the model
* Follow the installation instructions to install [Blender] and [Bonsai] and set up Blender and the Bonsai (fka BlenderBIM) add on.
<!--
* [Install](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/quickstart/installation.html) Blender and BlenderBIM following the instruction page~~, with the difference that you should follow the [unstable installation](https://blenderbim.org/docs/devs/installation.html#unstable-installation).~~
Here is also a [video explaination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-937k6fvKk&t=0s) by Ifc Architect (notice that the new version of BlenderBIM looks a bit different).
-->

### 4) View the model in Blender / Bonsai (fka BlenderBIM)
* [Exploring an IFC model](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/quickstart/explore_model.html)
* Managers should gather knowledge from groups in their focus area and the teaching team to work out the best way to support all the groups in their focus area through this activity.
* Please note that the Blender / Bonsai BIM ecosystem is being updated rapidly so some links below may not work as first intended. Please be patient and help each other learn :)
* [BlenderBIM/Bonsai interface guide](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/reference/interface.html)
* [understanding IFC](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/guides/authoring/understanding_ifc.html)
* [Starting a new IFC Project](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/quickstart/create_model.html)
* [Importing and Viewing IFC Models](https://docs.bonsaibim.org/quickstart/explore_model.html)
* You can use this [tool from Dion Moult](https://blenderbim.org/search-ifc-class.html) to help find the entities you are looks for also you can [search the IFC4 schema here](https://ifc43-docs.standards.buildingsmart.org/)

### Activity 3)
* Look for specific IFC entities in Blender.

### 5) Next Steps
You are now one step closer in your journey to becoming an OpenBIM guru. Check out the next session [here](https://github.com/timmcginley/41934/tree/main/Schedule/02).
