# Introduction to scripting with Ifcopenshell in system environment

In this activity you will set up the necessary environment for development using [Python] and [IfcOpenShell].
You will create a minimal script counting the amount of walls found in a given [IFC-STEP] model.

Knowledge of [Python] is assumed.

## Preparing development environment

Using Anaconda for managing your Python environment is recommended for advanced users.
When installing Anaconda, make sure to check the `Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable`-box.

Detailed instructions for installation is available at [Install Ifcopenshell](https://docs.ifcopenshell.org/ifcopenshell-python/installation.html).

- Make sure you have an appropriate text-editor installed. [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended.
- Make sure you have a recent version of Python installed. Python `3.11` is recommended.
- Install `ifcopenshell` either by:
    - PIP: In your [CLI] run `pip install ifcopenshell`.
    - Conda: `conda install -c conda-forge ifcopenshell pythonocc-core`. This includes [OpenCascade](https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core) which may be useful for geometric operations further down the road.

## Hello `ifcopenshell`

Here is a minimal example counting the amount of wall entities found in a model:

```python
import ifcopenshell
model = ifcopenshell.open('/path/to/your/model.ifc')

walls = model.by_type('IfcWall')
print(f"Walls in model: {len(walls)}")
```

Save the above code in a `.py` file and then execute it.
Watch the command line output to read the wall count.

```{attention}
Beware of absolute and relative file paths!
If pointing to your model using a relative path, the path is relative to the working directory _of which you are executing the code_, and not the path of the `.py` file itself.
