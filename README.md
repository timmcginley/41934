# 41934 Advanced BIM

In this course you will:

* Learn how to gather, analyze and communicate [building information] from [IFC] models for real architectural engineering challenges.
* Learn from peer crafted tutorials from previous years and teach your peers a new [concept] you have learnt.
* Make new tools or adapt previous ones that (if you decide to share them) can be used to develop and maintain the growing OpenBIM ecosystem of processes and tools that everyone can use and learn from for free.

All tools and processes developed in this course must be:

1. Open, FAIR and Standardised
2. Reusable and Maintainable
3. Agnostic and Guiding

FAIR and Open BIM tools, data, standards and processes processes, support interoperability in the building industry put you, the engineers and designers back in control of the process. Therefore this course focuses on Open BIM data and standards. Excitingly there is an emerging ecosystem of OpenBIM tools supported by [IfcOpenShell] and others that provide an Open BIM alternative to contemporary inoperable closed BIM tools and data.

## We are 100% commited to Open BIM
We believe that University education has a responsibility to support the transition in the AEC to OpenBIM data and standards. To achieve this, the Advanced BIM course at DTU offers:
* IFC, IfcOpenShell, Bonsai (fka BlenderBIM) and Python focus.
* 5 Emerging [Roles] for you to experience
* 5 Stimulating [Assignments] that support you to become an OpenBIM Champion / Guru
* Learning objectives aligned to the needs of the whole AEC and society (not just the software industry).
* A focus on the interests of Architectural Engineering Students, but also relevant for Civil Engineering students.
* Collection of OpenBIM [Concepts] to explore and build into your own Open and Standardised Processes.

## Course Aim

This course is different from other BIM courses. The idea is to learn _from_ BIM not learn _howto_ BIM. Therefore we will NOT be training you to model things in BIM tools.

In place of modelling we focus on analysing existing BIM models. The idea is that if you learn how to analyse the BIM models to get the information you need you will then know what to model. This leads us to our next aim, to model less. 

>What is the minimum information that should be exchanged to guide the person that requires that information?

The aim of the course is to support you to become an OpenBIM champion (guru) supported by your disciplinary expertise i.e. LCA or structural analysis for instance. At the end of the course your group is required to develop a tutorial to teach one of these concepts to a group of peers to demonstrate your expertise in the area. The course is divided into 5 [Assignments], each module builds on the previous one to guide you through identifying your use case and the data you need to analyse to create your tool. The course focuses on the IFC schema to provide you with a robust, future proof and interoperable understanding of BIM.

## Circular Education System
We think you learn best from your peers and feeling part of a community of learners.
Thats why we encourage you to learn from and improve upon previous work. The following examples contain the submissions of previous years. Please note that assignments change from year to year so the assignment number or content may differ between years. However we will try and keep it similar to help build a networked body of learning that you can use to support your own learning.

## Research Based Course
This course is research based and the result of the following papers.

* McGinley, Krijnen (2022) *[A framework for meta-disciplinary building analysis]*, ECPPM 2022
* McGinley, Karlsh√∏j (2022) *[A circular education system for the AEC]*, EC3 2022
* McGinley, Krijnen (2021) *[Multi Disciplinary Learning from OpenBIM]*, CIB W78 2021, Luxemburg.
## Course rules

1. Use FOSS (Free and Open Source) Solutions first.
1. No PDFs - replace with .md (this) and [.svg] for drawings
1. Try, reuse, learn from (and make iterative improvements) on existing solutions (circular digital tools).
2. Analyse real use cases from previous projects.
1. Help each other, if you work something out, cool, share it, you do not get extra credit for keeping it to yourself, but we really like it when you help each other :)
