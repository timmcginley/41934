# Learning Objectives
1. Create and manage a [BIM Execution Plan] based on the OpenBIM standard [ISO 19650]
2. Identify, locate and extract information from an [IFC] model in [OpenBIM] tools
3. Apply appropriate [OpenBIM] standards and guidelines to support open and [FAIR] data, tools and processes.
4. Provide professional [disciplinary] guidance based on [OpenBIM] [analysis].
5. Apply domain specific [linked data] ontologies.
6. Create, fork, branch and collaborate on the development of an [OpenBIM] tool in [Python] with peers in a [code repository].
7. Identify [BIM challenges] by analysing [OpenBIM] data.
8. Teach an advanced [BIM concept] you have learned in the course to your peers and reflect on peer feedback on this.
9. Identify and model a BIM use case based on the BIM challenges identified from analysis of an OpenBIM project in [BPMN].
10. Identify an appropriate [development methodology] for an [OpenBIM] tool or model to different [use cases].
11. Apply and improve programming skills in [Python] to develop an OpenBIM tool or [modelling] skills in OpenBIM using your engineering domain expertise.
12. Evaluate [software licensing] suitability and implications for the [OpenBIM] tool you develop or modelling tool you use.
