## Manager Levels
The OpenBIM Manager is based on the traditional BIM manager role, such as managing [clashes] Based on these skills, students could then work to develop OpenBIM Manager skills.

* Level 1: Analyse a standard IFC file in Excel generated using the IFA analyzer tool to check OpenBIM information availability and assign responsibilities.
* Level 2: Apply BPMN / UML modelling and investigations to identify new processes, information flows and procedures based on ISO 19650.
* Level 3: Systems Architect (McGinley, 2015) (operating at an information systems level) with process automation, possibly with Node-Red (Node-RED, 2023).
