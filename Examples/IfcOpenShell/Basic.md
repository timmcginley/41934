# Basic IfcOpenshell

**N.B.!** IfcOpenShell is a library for Python and thus follows the logic and syntax of the language. Having at least some basic knowledge of Python will make scripting with IfcOpenShell much easier and less confusing. If you don't have any experience with Python, doing some exercises from a tutorial site like  [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python "https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python") or  [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-free-python-courses-for-beginners/ "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-free-python-courses-for-beginners/") is strongly recommended. 

You can also start with [this tutorial](https://github.com/jakob-beetz/ifcopenshell-notebooks) on IfcOpenShell, as it also includes a crash course on Python. If you are already familiar with Python, you can jump to file 04_hello_ifc. This tutorial is made as Jupyter notebooks and doesn't require you to install anything, simply click on the button "launch, binder" at the top of the README.md and wait for it to load. If it doesn't work, you can also follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/jakob-beetz/IfcOpenShellScriptingTutorial/wiki) and run the scripts in your code editor. It has almost the same content as the interactive tutorial.

Below are small scripts and snippets that we've used over the run of this course. Try them out for yourself!

*N.B. in these examples for consistency we name the model 'model'; if you are using somethign different that is ok, but the idea here is to keep the code consistent to help you.*

## Loading and importing the model and IfcOpenShell into the code editor you are using

If you are in Blender and want to use the IFC model you have open in the model view:

```python

import bpy
from bonsai.bim.ifc import IfcStore
model = IfcStore.get_file()

```
If you are in an external code editor, terminal OR you are in Blender, but you want to use a different IFC model than the one you have loaded:

*N.B. please change the model for the one you are using :)*

```python
import ifcopenshell
model = ifcopenshell.open('model\Duplex_A_20110907.ifc')
```

## Basic Scripts

* [Basic 1A - Space count check](#basic-example-1a)
* [Basic 1B - Space count check - with len()](#basic-example-1b)
* [Basic 2 - Total beam length in model)](#basic-example-2)
* [Basic 3 - Get element PropertySets](#basic-example-3)
* [Basic 4 - Door code check](#basic-example-4)
* [Basic 5 - model load time](#basic-example-5)
* [Basic 6 - Get beam properties](#basic-example-6)
* [Basic 7 - Add a new property and property set to a wall](#basic-example-7)
* [Basic 8 - Change/add a new property to existing property set - using api](#basic-example-8)
* [Basic 9 - Add a new property set to a wall's material - using api](#basic-example-9)

### Basic Example 1a
Loop through the [entities] and then add one to the variable *spaces_in_model* each time we find an instance of that entity.

*remember to import ifcopenshell and load the model if you need to, see the [introduction](#Introduction) of this concept for more information.*

```python
spaces_required = 21
spaces_in_model = 0

for entity in model.by_type("IfcSpace"):
    spaces_in_model+=1

print(f"\nThere are {spaces_in_model} spaces in the model")

if spaces_required is spaces_in_model:
    print ('RESULT: The number of spaces is correct')
else:
    print ('RESULT: The number of spaces is wrong')
```

### Basic Example 1b
Use len() to count the number of [entities] (without having to loop through all of them).

*remember to import ifcopenshell and load the model if you need to, see the [introduction](#Introduction) of this example for more information.*

```python
spaces_required = 21
spaces_in_model = len(model.by_type("IfcSpace"))

print(f"\nThere are {spaces_in_model} spaces in the model")

if spaces_required is spaces_in_model:
    print ('RESULT: The number of spaces is correct')
else:
    print ('RESULT: The number of doors is wrong')
```

Rule: In this example we will try to quantify the length of the beam. We will base this on the for loop we defined in example 1A.

### Basic Example 2
Quantify [use] case code example

*remember to import ifcopenshell and load the model if you need to, see the [introduction](#Introduction) of this concept for more information.*

```python
total_beam_Length = 0

for entity in model.by_type("IfcBeam"):
    #we need to get the attributes
   for relDefinesByProperties in entity.IsDefinedBy:
        for prop in relDefinesByProperties.RelatingPropertyDefinition.HasProperties:
            #and then get the attribute we are looking for
            if prop.Name == 'Length':
                #add the length to the total length
                total_beam_length += prop.NominalValue.wrappedValue

print(f"\nThere are {total_beam_Length} meters of beam in the model")
```

### Basic Example 3
Get the property sets of an element.

*remember to import ifcopenshell and load the model if you need to, see the [introduction](#Introduction) of this concept for more information.*

```Python
# this just gets you the entity, defined here as wall
# feel free to change this to your needs
# appending [0] to the end means that we only get the first entity
# if you remove the [0] you will get all the ifcwall entitities in the model.
# If you are using a model in an older IFC version like 2x3, there are other classes that describe a wall (HINT: IfcWallStandardCase)

wall = model.by_type('IfcWall')[0]
for definition in wall.IsDefinedBy:
	# To support IFC2X3, we need to filter our results.
	if definition.is_a('IfcRelDefinesByProperties'):
		property_set = definition.RelatingPropertyDefinition
		# Might return Pset_WallCommon
		print(property_set.Name)
```

### Basic Example 4
Door code check.

```Python
doors_required = 14 ### <- Expected value of doors ### 
doors_in_model = len(model.by_type("IfcDoor")) 
min_width_door = 0.77 
valid_doors=0 
invalid_doors=0 
 
print ('\n') 
 
# initial check to establish if we have the 'correct' number of doors 
if doors_required is doors_in_model: 
    print("Result matches expected value ({})".format(doors_required)) 
elif doors_required > doors_in_model: 
    print("There are more doors than expected") 
elif doors_required < doors_in_model: 
    print("There are less doors than expected")      
print ('\n')  
# check each door to see if it complies and count the valid ones 
for door in model.by_type("IfcDoor"): 
    print ("door with width: "+str(door.OverallWidth))   
    if door.OverallWidth>=min_width_door: 
        valid_doors+=1       
# now we have finished the counting we can pull back the indents and print the result         
print(f"\nThe width of {valid_doors} doors is according to the Danish Regulations") 
print(f"The width of {doors_in_model-valid_doors} doors is not according to the Danish Regulations") 
```

### Basic Example 5
This code gets the time taken to load a model.

*This code includes the import and model loading as it is a special case.*

```Python
import ifcopenshell
import time
import pandas

# starting time
start = time.time()

model = ifcopenshell.open("model/Duplex_A_20110907.ifc")
end = time.time()

print()# total time taken
print(f"model load time is... {end - start}\n")
```

### Basic Example 6

*This code includes the import and model loading as it is a special case.*

```Python

## Run script in blender
import bpy
from blenderbim.bim.ifc import IfcStore

file = IfcStore.get_file()

### GET PROPERTIES ###

## Get attributes directly from the element
spaces = file.by_type("IfcSpace")

for space in spaces:
    print(space.LongName)

## go through all the beams in the model
beams = file.by_type("IfcBeam")

for beam in beams:
    beam.Name
    ## get property sets attached to beams through IsDefinedBy"
    for definition in beam.IsDefinedBy:
        
        ## To support IFC2X3, we need to filter our results.
        if definition.is_a('IfcRelDefinesByProperties'):
            property_set = definition.RelatingPropertyDefinition
            
            
            ## Sort by the name of the propertySet
            if property_set.Name == "Pset_BeamCommon":
               for property in property_set.HasProperties:
                    
                    #print(property)
                    ## sort b the name of the property
                    if property.Name == "IsExternal":
                        print(property.NominalValue.wrappedValue)

### GET MATERIALS ###

## Through HasAssociations get the associated materials of the element
for beam in beams:
    for relAssociatesMaterial in beam.HasAssociations:
        print(relAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial.Name)


### GET RELATING STRUCTURE ###

## Through ContainedInStructure get the inverse relation to the 
for beam in beams:
    for relContainedInSpatialStructure in beam.ContainedInStructure:
        print(relContainedInSpatialStructure.RelatingStructure.Name)
```

### Basic Example 7
*In this example the IFC file is imported as `model`*.

This is the 'old' way of creating and assigning properties and property sets. Here you have to define the data type, GUID, owner history, relationships and other yourself. Property sets are assigned using the [IfcRelDefinesByProperties](https://ifc43-docs.standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4x3/HTML/lexical/IfcRelDefinesByProperties.htm) relationship. 

In this example two properties are created; one property with the name "Some Property Name" and with the type "IfcText", and one with the name "ThermalTransmittance" and with the type "IfcReal". If you want to store another type of value than arbitrary text, take a look at the types defined here: [IfcSimpleValue](https://ifc43-docs.standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4x3/HTML/lexical/IfcSimpleValue.htm) and [IfcMeasureValue](https://ifc43-docs.standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4x3/HTML/lexical/IfcMeasureValue.htm). 

If you want to add properties already defined in the IFC schema (recommended) you should use the exact names and data types defined for them in the documentation.
If you want to add more properties to the same property set, just add them them to the list called property_values.

``` python
# Assign a property set to a wall - old method
walls = model.by_type("IfcWall")
wall = walls[0]
# get the owner history of the model
owner_history = model.by_type("IfcOwnerHistory")[0]
# define new properties and place them inside a list
property_values = [
    model.createIfcPropertySingleValue(
        "Some Property Name",
        None,
        model.create_entity("IfcText", "Some Value"),
        None,
    ),
    model.createIfcPropertySingleValue(
        "ThermalTransmittance",
        None,
        model.create_entity("IfcReal", 2.569),
        None,
    ),
]

# create a new property set and add properties to it
property_set = model.createIfcPropertySet(
    ifcopenshell.guid.new(),
    owner_history,
    "Some Property Set Name",
    None,
    property_values,
)
# create a ralationship between the property set and the wall
model.createIfcRelDefinesByProperties(
    ifcopenshell.guid.new(), owner_history, None, None, [wall], property_set
)

# print wall property sets including your new property set
wall_psets = ifcopenshell.util.element.get_psets(wall)
print(wall_psets)
```
### Basic Example 8
*In this example the IFC file is imported as `model`*.

An easier way of changing getting and changing properties is using the `util` and `api` functions. For the `api` functions to work, you first need to import them with:
`import ifcopenshell.api`

Here, we're using the [ifcopenshell.util.element.get_pset](https://blenderbim.org/docs-python/autoapi/ifcopenshell/util/element/index.html#ifcopenshell.util.element.get_pset) function to retrieve the wall's property set and [ifcopenshell.api.pset.edit_pset](https://blenderbim.org/docs-python/autoapi/ifcopenshell/api/pset/edit_pset/index.html) function to edit an existing property set without having to define GUIDs, relationships, data types etc. on our own.

The `should_inherit` parameter of `ifcopenshell.util.element.get_pset` function defines if the element's property sets should also be inherited from the type, eg. IfcWallType (`should_inherit = True`) or only from the element, eg. IfcWall (`should_inherit = False`).

`ifcopenshell.api.pset.edit_pset` function will change the value of a property if it's already defined for an element and add it as a new property if it's not.

```python
# Change the value of an existing property/add a new property to an existing property set (using api)
walls = model.by_type("IfcWall")
wall = walls[0]
# get the properties inside the Pset_WallCommon property set on the element level.
# Returns a dictionary with the property name as key and the property value as value.
wall_common_pset = ifcopenshell.util.element.get_pset(
    wall, "Pset_WallCommon", should_inherit=False
)
# edit the property set by providing the property set as an IFC object and a dictionary with the properties to change.
# existing properties will be changed, new properties will be added.
ifcopenshell.api.run(
    "pset.edit_pset",
    model,
    pset=model.by_id(wall_common_pset["id"]),
    properties={"LoadBearing": False, "FireRating": "R30"},
)

# print Pset_WallCommon property set before and after the change
print(wall_common_pset)
wall_common_pset_after = ifcopenshell.util.element.get_pset(
    wall, "Pset_WallCommon", should_inherit=False
)
print(wall_common_pset)
```

### Basic Example 9
*In this example the IFC file is imported as `model`*.

You can add a new property set to any IfcProduct by using the [ifcopenshell.api.pset.add_pset](https://blenderbim.org/docs-python/autoapi/ifcopenshell/api/pset/add_pset/index.html) function. Custom property sets and official property sets that are part of the IFC are created in the same way. If you want to add an official property set, just follow the naming defined in the schema exactly.

Remember that any custom property sets cannot start with the "Pset_" prefix.

In this example we're getting the material of a specific wall using the `ifcopenshell.util.element.get_material` function, but you can also get the materials directly with `model.by_type("IfcMaterial")`. See more functions related to materials [here](https://blenderbim.org/docs-python/autoapi/ifcopenshell/api/material/).

```python
# Assign a property set to a material of a wall
walls = model.by_type("IfcWall")
wall = walls[0]

# get the material of the wall
wall_material = ifcopenshell.util.element.get_material(wall)
# create a new property set and add it to the material
new_material_pset = ifcopenshell.api.run(
    "pset.add_pset", model, product=wall_material, name="Your Property Set Name"
)
# edit the property set by providing a dictionary with the properties to define
ifcopenshell.api.run(
    "pset.edit_pset",
    model,
    pset=new_material_pset,
    properties={"PropertyName1": "TextValue", "PropertyName2": 2.0},
)

# print materials property sets including your new property set
material_psets = ifcopenshell.util.element.get_psets(wall_material)
print(material_psets)
```
