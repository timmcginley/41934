## Architecture / Fire evacuation / Acoustics

```{dropdown} **Group 2**: Checking desks in IfcSpaces

This tutorial helps with identifying, locating, listing and verifying building elements for desks in IfcSpaces spefically. Using python, bonsai and ifcopenshell, and a given BIM model the code from A3 can find misplaced desks and check compliance following BR18 and 'Arbejdstilsynet' the governmental body regulating working spaces. The results are then presented in a seperate .txt file for futherer analysis.

```

```{dropdown} **Group 4**: Checking Fire Evacuation Routes in Public Buildings

The script extracts the relevant fire evacuation elements from a building model in IFC format. It evaluates the requirements listed in BR18 for the width, compartmentation and whether a corridor is a 'fire-proof hallway' or not.

```


## Indoor & Energy / Acoustic / Daylight

```{dropdown} **Group 10**: Automatic daylight calculations based on room and window areas

This script seeks to automatically make the calculations necessary to do the 10% rule for 
daylight calculations. This is done by finding room areas and window areas and then 
comparing the two. A simple GUI has also been made to make the process much easier.

```

```{dropdown} **Group 12**: Explaining our Automatic BCF Issue Generator

For this tutorial, we explain how our bcfGenerator.py module works and how it is used in our tool. The tutorial consists of a jupyter notebook.

```

```{dropdown} **Group 13**: Calculation of ventilation rate

By reading information directly from an IFC model, the tool extracts each space’s area, occupancy and calculates the required ventilation rates accordingly.

```

```{dropdown} **Group 15**: IFC Thermal Quantifier: Automated Envelope Analysis and Reporting

A Python tool that parses IFC models to quantify building envelope thermal performance. It calculates composite U-values, handles geometric area extraction, and generates detailed Excel reports for thermal analysis.

```

```{dropdown} **Group 18**: Identifying IFC types in MEP models

Explains common IFC type names used in MEP models and shows how to determine which names appear in a given IFC file, addressing inconsistencies where identical components may be assigned different classifications across models.

## Structure inc. Structural Fire Safety

```{dropdown} **Group 20**: IFC Column axial capacity analysis

The scripts extracts Columns geometry (to find cross-section area), Info about the material, Concrete strength and then calculates the Axial capacity for all columns in the user defined level. It also handles missing material property sets.

```{dropdown} **Group 22**: Manager group for structural

We are the Manager group so we decided with tim to give a brief overview and a reflection on how to be manager in our A4 assignment.

Access at: [GitHub](https://github.com/banats213/E25_41934_Structural/tree/main/A4)
```

```{dropdown} **Group 23**: Concrete beam width checking according to Eurocode 2

Tool that reads concrete beam sections from IFC, checks Eurocode 2 width rules, estimates bending and shear capacity, and exports structured results to Excel or CSV for documentation.

Access at: [GitHub](https://github.com/s223903/BIManalyst_g_23/tree/main/A4)
```

```{dropdown} **Group 24**: Detecting Load-Bearing Walls and Fire Safety Compliance Using OpenBIM

A Python-based OpenBIM tool that automatically identifies load-bearing walls from IFC models without relying on the LoadBearing flag. It compares architectural and structural data, infers real load-bearing elements, and checks if they satisfy R120 fire-resistance requirements according to EN 1992-1-2.

Access at: [GitHub](https://github.com/diegob1212/BIManalyst_g_24/tree/main/A4)
```

```{dropdown} **Group 29**: Beam Uniform Load Capacity Calculator

The first step is to open the main file and import your .IFC model. It then gets loaded into the dimensions script. The resulting dimensions are then used to find the max ULC. These results are then processed and printed.

## Materials / LCA / Materials / Sustainability Assessment

```{dropdown} **Group 32**: How to LCA in BIM

Want to conduct an LCA directly from BIM without running into unit errors or missing materials? Stay tuned! This tutorial will present three key factors that simplify GWP calculations using an IFC file and our A3 tool.

Access at: [GitHub](https://github.com/s223929/41934---Advanced-BIM-Materials/tree/main/A4)
```

```{dropdown} **Group 33**: LCA calculation of the STR-model

The tool creates an entire LCA calculation of the STR-model. It does this by taking quantities and materials from the model and writing them into a json-file that can be imported directly into LCAbyg.

```


## Build / Cost / Buildability / Permits

```{dropdown} **Group 42**: Rapid IFC-Based Architectural Cost Estimator

This video tutorial and walkthrough show how the tool supports quick pre- or post-estimation checks, offering an approachable way to validate existing cost estimations or gain early economic insight without committing to a complete, comprehensive estimate.

Access at: [GitHub](https://github.com/Grumstrup1/41934_G42/tree/main/A4)
```

```{dropdown} **Group 46**: Structural Cost Estimation using Pset-based Price Lists

This tool estimates costs and enriches the IFC model with IfcCostSchedule, IfcCostItem and IfcCostValue. A matching function assigns costs based on a custom price list unit multiplied by the IfcElementQuantity for each structural element.

Access at: [GitHub](https://github.com/riccardopadoan28/BIManalyst_g_46/tree/main/A4)
```

```{dropdown} **Group 48**: GFA estimate, area distribution and rough price estimate

Calculates GFA from NetFloorAreas and Wall/Column footprint, returns GFA and distribution of areas across area types, calculates rough estimate based on price per m 2 input.

Access at: [GitHub](https://github.com/Schabinsky/BIManalyst_g_48/tree/main/A4)
```

```{dropdown} **Group 49**: Web-Based IFC Space Classification for Cost Allocation

A localhost web interface that processes IFC data, classifies spaces, and distributes costs using adjustable weights, providing fast and transparent insights for BIM-based planning and analysis.

```


## Miscellaneous

```{dropdown} **Group 1**: Github tutorial for OpenBIM Managers

This video shows OpenBIM Managers how to correctly set up GitHub so the workflow runs smoothly and as intended. It can also be helpful for OpenBIM analysts to understand the setup process, even though their workflow differs.
