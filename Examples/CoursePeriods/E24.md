## Architecture / Fire evacuation / Acoustics

<!-- Group 1 -->
```{dropdown} **Group 1**: How to Identify Mislabeled Building Elements and Reclassify Them

This tutorial teaches identifying and correcting mislabeled building elements, focusing on misclassified ceilings. Using python, ifcopenshell, and the BIM model to ensure that the labelling inconsisities are reclassified.

<!-- Group 11 -->
```{dropdown} **Group 11**: Surface Analysis and Reverberation Calculation

This script detects floor surfaces and surrounding surfaces to make up all rooms. Then it filters out irrelevant rooms and calculates reverberation time for the relevant rooms that are left. This gives an estimate of the acoustic competences of every room.

## Indoor & Energy / Acoustic / Daylight

<!-- Group 33 -->
```{dropdown} **Group 33**: Extracting U-values from Model

The functuality of the program is that it extracts U-values from the model, from external walls, the roof and slabs to be exact. After that it compares the U-values to the DGNB lite certification.

```

<!-- Group 15 -->
```{dropdown} **Group 15**: U-Value Calculation Tool for Windows and Glazing

This Python-based tool calculates the U-Value of windows and glazing systems, simulating their impact on thermal insulation and daylight performance. It aids in optimizing energy efficiency in building design within BIM environments.

```

<!-- Group 14 -->
```{dropdown} **Group 14**: Ventilation Validation Tool from BIM Models

This project involves creating a tool to extract ventilation components, quantities and airflow properties from BIM-models. The tool streamlines compliance validation for ventilation systems by analyzing IFC-files and generating structured data for engineers.

## Structure inc. Structural Fire Safety

No submissions.

## Materials / LCA / Materials / Sustainability Assessment

<!-- Group 4 -->
```{dropdown} **Group 4**: Using Python and Ifcopenshell to estimate building's CO2 emission

 A python tool that takes advantage of ifcopenshell library to extract element quantity and material information and combines it with external CO2 emission factors to calculate annual CO2 footprint of building elements. The tool also provides plots for better assessment of the results.

<!-- Group 23 -->
```{dropdown} **Group 23**: Volume Calculation for Objects in an IFC-File

When looking for the volume of an object, we stumbled uppon the issue, that some objects don't have a volume attribute in the IFC-File. So we decided to calculate the volume with a simple code. In the first step, the code is getting the dimensions of the objects in the x, y and z direction. After that, the volume is calculated by using the correct formula, depending on the shape of the object.

<!-- Group 35 -->
```{dropdown} **Group 35**: CO₂ Footprint Calculation Tool for Structural Concrete

A Python-based OpenBIM tool to estimate CO₂ footprints of concrete walls, slabs, and columns in the design phase using IFC data, promoting sustainability and compliance with environmental standards.

## Build / Cost / Buildability / Permits

<!-- Group 40 -->
```{dropdown} **Group 40**: Modifying the extracted ifc type name from model

The tutorial shows how to modify the extracted name of an element type so that we get the suitable format to use in the tool.

Access at: [GitHub](https://github.com/Odanorland/BIManalyst_g_40_new/)

```

<!-- Group 41 -->
```{dropdown} **Group 41**: Cost Estimation with IfcPsets

The tool estimates facade costs by analyzing IFC files with Python and IfcOpenShell. It identifies curtain walls, extracts surface areas via property sets, and calculates costs using unit rates. Designed for OpenBIM workflows, it aligns with standards emphasizing interoperability, enabling precise cost analysis and enhanced data-driven decision-making in BIM processes.
