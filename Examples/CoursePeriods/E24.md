<!-- Group 23 -->
```{dropdown} **Group 23**: Volume Calculation for Objects in an IFC-File

When looking for the volume of an object, we stumbled uppon the issue, that some objects don't have a volume attribute in the IFC-File. So we decided to calculate the volume with a simple code. In the first step, the code is getting the dimensions of the objects in the x, y and z direction. After that, the volume is calculated by using the correct formula, depending on the shape of the object.
