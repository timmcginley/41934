# A5: Project Reflection

*Details on how to submit this, will be provided closer to the time.*

In this project you will use the peer feedback and the feedback from the companies to your 2 minute videos and tools to write a brief reflection on 
* the process of creating the tool
* the output of the tool. 


1. process of developing the tool
* Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
* Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
* Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we haev more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

2. output of the tool
* did the tool address the use case you identified?
* was the use case well modelled
* was the project clearly scoped

3. Future

* Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis
* Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
