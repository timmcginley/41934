## Assignment

In this assignment we want you to idenitfy a [use case] that you are really passionate about and want to develop a tool for in [A3]. Additionally it will help you collate a data bank of issues you are not sure about to add to learning need bank, that groups can address in the tutorials for [A4].

### A2: About your group
how much do you agree wiht the following statement, the number gives your coding level, please provide your total score for your group.

>I am confident coding in Python

  * 0 - Strongly Disagree
  * 1 - Disagree
  * 2 - Neutral
  * 3 - Agree
  * 4 - Strongly Agree

What is your group's focus area?
Is you focus area keeping the manager role? Are you an analyst or a manager?

### A2a: Identify Claim
* Review the reports from last year's Advanced Building Design Course. We currently have 3 to choose from.
  * Building #2406
  * Building #2410
  * Building #2411
* Select which building(s) to focus on for you focus area.
* Identify a 'claim' to check from one of those reports.
* Justify your selection of your claim.
  
### A2b: Use Case
* **How** you would check this claim?
* What **phase**? planning, design, build or operation.
* What BIM **purpose** is required? Gather, generate, analyse, communicate or realise?
* Review [use case] examples - do any of these help?, What BIM use case is this closest to? If you cannot find one from the examples, you can make a new one.
* Produce a [BPMN] drawing for your chosen use case. link to this so we can see it in your markdown file. To do this you will have to save it as an SVG, please also save the BPMN with it. 
  
### A2c: Scope the use case
* From the 'whole use case' identify where a new script / function / tool is needed. Highlight this in your BPMN diagram. Show this clearly in a new SVG diagram. You may wish to change the SVG diagram, you can use [inkscape] for this task.
  
### A2d: Experience
* State your starting point in terms of your experience working with Python calculating for each member of your group:
  (1 never coded before, 2 some experience with python, 3 experienced with python, 4 python expert)
* Provide the total score for your group.

### A2e: Tool Idea
* Describe in words your idea for your own OpenBIM ifcOpenShell Tool in Python.
* Produce a diagram to summarise your idea (could be in the form of a BPMN diagram).
  
## A2f: Information Requirements
* Identify what information you need to extract from the model
     * Where is this in IFC?
     * Is it in the model?
     * Do you know how to get it in ifcOpenShell?
     * What will you need to learn to do this? - add this to the 'learnign need bank' on teams.
 
## A2g:

## IDS
2. Produce an [IDS] to be used in future projects that can check you have the information needed for your tool.


## Identify a claim to check from last year's Advanced Building Design Course
Review the repsorts from last year's Advanced Building Design and identify a focus area issue/claim/fact you would like to check.
Consider:
* When would this claim need to be checked?
* What information does this claim rely on?
* 
Review the repsorts from last year's Advanced Building Design and identify a focus area issue/claim/fact you would like to check.
* Review use case examples - do any of these follow you case?
* Develop an idea for a tool.
* What is the [business and societal value] of your tool?
* Scope the use case to the needs of the tool.
* Identify what information you need to extract from the model
     * Where is this in IFC?
     * Is it in the model?
     * Do you know how to get it in ifcOpenShell?
     * What will you need to learn to do this? **[Enrolled students only]:** [add to this excel in teams](https://dtudk.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/course215344/Delte%20dokumenter/General/Learning%20Bank.xlsx?d=w1436615b07ec4312af23ece1231635a2&csf=1&web=1&e=ZBDAPj)

## Introduce other models
* Group 10
* Group 11

## Identify something that you would like to analyse from the BIM model.
* 


## A2A: Identify a BIM use case
Write a short description of the use case from your chosen focus area. The use case could be to check the claim you made in the previous assingment, or if this is too simple you could identify a new claim from the report to check in this assignment. For inspriation you could check the BEATS of the project. 

Examples could be:
* Calculate structural integrity of beams and columns.
* Perform an LCA of the building.
* Perform a daylight analysis of all the relevant spaces.

## A2B: Create a BPMN diagram of the use case saved as [SVG]
You can use this online tool to create a [BPMN file](https://bpmn.io/).
Your use case diagram should:
* Describe all stages and processes of the use case
* Shows the exchange of information between the stakeholders in the use case
      * Show the inputs and outputs between your tool and other data models, experts, stakeholders etc.
* Clearly show the exchange of information between your tool and the IFC model. Which specific IFC classes are being checked or manipulated?

[Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timmcginley/41934/main/Assignments/images/EnergyAnalysisComplexIDMdiagram.png) is a more complex [IDM](/Concepts/IDM) diagram of Energy Analysis.

See [this document](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/documents/IDM/IDM_guide-QuickGuideToBPMN-2007_01.pdf) and [this page](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/information-delivery-manual/) from buildingSMART for more information about creating [IDM](/Concepts/IDM) diagrams using BPMN.

## A2C: Define the SCOPE of your script
Using the diagram of your use case, identify the a part of it that you can execute in your script.
You can either clearly mark the part of the diagram from A2D that defines your scope or you can produce a new diagram.
Show the processes and logic of your tool in as much detail as possible (whithin reason). What information are you extracting and what happens with it throughout the script?

Focus on the early stage the larger use case, that is checking the model for information and either getting it ready for further simulations or maybe doing some simple calculations.




## IDS

Produce a simple IDS for the use case.

### Delivery
Requirements:
+ [x] **Markdown-formated report: Describing your tool/workflow: upload link to your Github report on Learn**
+ [X] **If you use the Skylab model please do NOT upload it at github**
+ [X] **If you use another .ifc model please upload in the folder structure at github as described in the beginning of the assignment**
      
The report should link to or include:
- [x] Two BPMN-diagrams
- [x] IFC model for the use case before the remodelling
- [x] IFC model for the use case after the remodelling
- [x] Description of and the script(s) used for the use case

## A2A: Import the IFC model into BlenderBIM
* Import one of the Advanced Building Design Models into [BlenderBIM] and explore the IFC file and its properties.

### Optional: Add quantities to the IFC model
Skylab IFC models don't have quantities (Quantity Sets) defined for any of the elements. Quantity Sets define physical dimensions of objects like lenght, width, area and volume. Quantities are very important to have access to in a model and they are luckly easy to add to a model in BlenderBIM. Watch [this video](https://github.com/timmcginley/41934/blob/main/Concepts/BlenderBIM/AddQuantitiesToIfcModelInBlenderBIM/README.md) to see how to do it. Remember to save your modified IFC model and include it in your assignment submission. 

> N.B.: Please don't modify the IFC models in any other way or add any other information to them in this assignment. 

## A2B: Explore the model with scripts
* In the scripting window you can then use IfcOpenShell to further explore the model by following examples in the [tutorials](/Examples/IfcOpenShell/Basic).



## A3B Reflect
* Check the new numbers – using your scripts from the previous assignment
* Check your conformance to the BEP.

## A3B Remodel
Usecase: the Skylab-model (it is allowed to use other models, but they need to be IFC4 formatted)
Purpose: *modify, add* or *subtract* information in the model by using IfcOpenShell (You decide what modification is needed)
