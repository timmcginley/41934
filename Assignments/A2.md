# A2: Use Case

| | Use Case Assignment  |
| --- | ----- |
| **Aim**|  Define use case for a [focus] area fact checking tool.  |
| **Complexity**| Low - Medium: The claim might be more complex but you only need to plan how you would do it, not actually do it until [A3] |
| **Tools** |  [BPMN].io / [Markdown] / [SVG] |
| **Models** |  Advanced Building Design (Circular Education System) |
| **[Analyst]** | BIM Use case to validate medium - complex claim made in report.  |
| **[Manager]** | BIM Use case to coordinate and communicate focus area checks |
| **Groups** | 2 - 3 people group for a specific [focus] area |
| **Practice:** | In class activity in week [4]  |

The aim of this assignment is to support you to develop the custom code that you will produce in your main assignment [A4]

## A2A: Identify a BIM use case.
Write a short description of your use case.
Examples of use cases could be:
* Calculate structural integrity of beams and columns.
* Perform an LCA of the building.
* Perform a daylight analysis of all the relevant spaces.

## A2B: Create a BPMN diagram of the use case
You can use this online tool to create a [BPMN file](https://bpmn.io/).
Your use case diagram should:
* Describe all stages and processes of the use case
* Shows the exchange of information between the stakeholders in the use case
      * Show the inputs and outputs between your tool and other data models, experts, stakeholders etc.
* Clearly show the exchange of information between your tool and the IFC model. Which specific IFC classes are being checked or manipulated?

### 04 A BPMN diagram saved as [SVG].
* Produce a [BPMN] diagram that describes the use case.

* Helps you to see what inputs and outputs your use case has.

[Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timmcginley/41934/main/Assignments/images/EnergyAnalysisComplexIDMdiagram.png) is a more complex [IDM](/Concepts/IDM) diagram of Energy Analysis.

See [this document](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/documents/IDM/IDM_guide-QuickGuideToBPMN-2007_01.pdf) and [this page](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/information-delivery-manual/) from buildingSMART for more information about creating [IDM](/Concepts/IDM) diagrams using BPMN.

## A2C: Define the SCOPE of your script
Using the diagram of your use case, identify the a part of it that you can execute in your script.
You can either clearly mark the part of the diagram from A2D that defines your scope or you can produce a new diagram.
Show the processes and logic of your tool in as much detail as possible (whithin reason). What information are you extracting and what happens with it throughout the script?

Focus on the early stage the larger use case, that is checking the model for information and either getting it ready for further simulations or maybe doing some simple calculations.


## A2D Plan
* Produce a [BIM execution plan] (BEP) for the assignment
For this assignment it is suggested you should focus on the:

- Model Uses, e.g. what is the tool/setup meant to do? Who will use it? In relation to what goals?
- Process, e.g. what other roles and people are you relying on before, and after using the tool/setup? who will take the information from you? and use it for what? Is it an iterative process? is it defined linearly?
- Information Exchange. e.g. What is the level of detailing (expected) for your tool/setup to work as intended? what is the LOD after running your tool/setup? Are you relying on classification systems? standards?
There are many other areas you can look into, but some are less relevant to your implementation, so rather than trying to write about everything, please try to focus on what your tool/setup really tries to achieve.

The figure includes a five-step procedure including goals, model uses, process, information exchanges and infrastructure.


### Delivery
Requirements:
+ [x] **Markdown-formated report: Describing your tool/workflow: upload link to your Github report on Learn**
+ [X] **If you use the Skylab model please do NOT upload it at github**
+ [X] **If you use another .ifc model please upload in the folder structure at github as described in the beginning of the assignment**
      
The report should link to or include:
- [x] Two IDM-diagrams
- [x] IFC model for the use case before the remodelling
- [x] IFC model for the use case after the remodelling
- [x] Description of and the script(s) used for the use case

## Submission 2024
Enrolled students submit on DTU Learn [here](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/d2l/lms/dropbox/user/folders_list.d2l?ou=215344&isprv=0)





### 04.5 A modified BPMN diagram saved as SVG that defines the scope of your tool.
* Helps you to define the scope of your script

This can either be a new diagram, or the same diagram with your scope clearly marked with a colour. 

### Learning Objectives
* 01 Create and manage a [BIM Execution Plan based](/Concepts/BIMEexecutionPlan) on the OpenBIM standard [ISO 19650](/Concepts/ISO19650/README.md)
* 04 Provide professional disciplinary guidance based on OpenBIM analysis.
* 07 Identify and model a BIM use case based on the BIM challenges identified from analysis of an OpenBIM project in BPMN.
* 09 Identify and model a BIM use case based on the BIM challenges identified from analysis of an OpenBIM project in [BPMN](/Concepts/BPMN/README.md).
* 10 Identify an appropriate [development methodology](/Concepts/Development_methodology) for an OpenBIM tool or model to different use cases.
* 12 Evaluate [software licensing](/Concepts/Software_licences/README.md) suitability and implications for the OpenBIM tool you develop or modelling tool you use.

## A2A: Import the IFC model into BlenderBIM
* Import one of the Advanced Building Design Models into [BlenderBIM] and explore the IFC file and its properties.

### Optional: Add quantities to the IFC model
Skylab IFC models don't have quantities (Quantity Sets) defined for any of the elements. Quantity Sets define physical dimensions of objects like lenght, width, area and volume. Quantities are very important to have access to in a model and they are luckly easy to add to a model in BlenderBIM. Watch [this video](https://github.com/timmcginley/41934/blob/main/Concepts/BlenderBIM/AddQuantitiesToIfcModelInBlenderBIM/README.md) to see how to do it. Remember to save your modified IFC model and include it in your assignment submission. 

> N.B.: Please don't modify the IFC models in any other way or add any other information to them in this assignment. 

## A2B: Explore the model with scripts
* In the scripting window you can then use IfcOpenShell to further explore the model by following examples in the [tutorials](/Examples/IfcOpenShell/Basic).



## A3B Reflect
* Check the new numbers â€“ using your scripts from the previous assignment
* Check your conformance to the BEP.

## A3B Remodel
Usecase: the Skylab-model (it is allowed to use other models, but they need to be IFC4 formatted)
Purpose: *modify, add* or *subtract* information in the model by using IfcOpenShell (You decide what modification is needed)
