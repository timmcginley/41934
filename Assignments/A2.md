# A2: Use Case

| | Use Case Assignment  |
| --- | ----- |
| **Aim**|  Define use case for a [focus] area fact checking tool.  |
| **Complexity**| Low - Medium: The claim might be more complex but you only need to plan how you would do it, not actually do it until [A3] |
| **Tools** |  [BPMN].io / [Markdown] / [SVG] |
| **Models** |  Advanced Building Design Buildings #2501,#2506,#2508 and #2516 |
| **[Analyst]** | BIM Use case to validate medium - complex claim made in report.  |
| **[Manager]** | BIM Use case to coordinate and communicate focus area checks. Rememer that you can also build on the checks of the analysts to offer new composite insights. The Managers output should be greater than the sum of its parts. |
| **Groups** | 2 - 3 people group for a specific [focus] area |
| **Practice:** | In class activity in week [4],[5] and [6] |

## Assignment

In this assignment we want you to identify a [use case] that you are really passionate about and want to develop a tool for in [A3]. Additionally it will help you collate a data bank of issues you are not sure about to add to learning need bank, that groups can address in the tutorials for [A4].

### A2a: About your group
how much do you agree with the following statement, the number gives your coding level, please provide your total score for your group.

>I am confident coding in Python

  * 0 - Strongly Disagree
  * 1 - Disagree
  * 2 - Neutral
  * 3 - Agree
  * 4 - Strongly Agree

What is your group's focus area?
Is you focus area keeping the manager role? Are you an analyst or a manager?

### A2b: Identify Claim
* Review the reports from last year's Advanced Building Design Course. We currently have 3 to choose from.
  * Building #2501
  * Building #2506
  * Building #2508
  * Building #2516
* Select which building(s) to focus on for you focus area.
* Identify a 'claim' / issue / fact to check from one of those reports.
* Write a short description of the claim you wish to check. It could be the same as the previous assignment, or if this is too simple you could identify a new claim from the report to check in this assignment. For inspriation you could check the BEATS of the project. Examples could be:
  * Calculate structural integrity of beams and columns.
  * Perform an LCA of the building.
  * Perform a daylight analysis of all the relevant spaces.
* Justify your selection of your claim.
  
### A2c: Use Case
* **How** you would check this claim?
* When would this claim need to be checked?
* What information does this claim rely on?
* What **phase**? planning, design, build or operation.
* What BIM **purpose** is required? Gather, generate, analyse, communicate or realise?
* Review [use case] examples - do any of these help?, What BIM use case is this closest to? If you cannot find one from the examples, you can make a new one.
* Produce a [BPMN]-diagram for your chosen use case. Link to this so we can see it in your markdown file. To do this you will have to save it as an SVG, please also save the BPMN with it. You can use this [online tool](https://bpmn.io/) to create BPMN-diagrams.

```{Important}
BPMN, specifically BPMN-2.0, is an open standard to describe business processes.
BPMN-diagrams consists of well defined symbols.

Familiarize yourself with the [BPMN symbol reference](https://camunda.com/bpmn/reference/).
Particularily read:
- [Tasks](https://camunda.com/bpmn/reference/#activities-task)
- Gateways ([XOR](https://camunda.com/bpmn/reference/#gateways-data-based-exclusive-gateways), [AND](https://camunda.com/bpmn/reference/#gateways-parallel-gateways) & [OR](https://camunda.com/bpmn/reference/#gateways-data-based-inclusive-gateways))
- [Lanes](https://camunda.com/bpmn/reference/#participants-lane)

```

  
Your use case diagram should:
* Describe all stages and processes of the use case
* Shows the exchange of information between the stakeholders in the use case
      * Show the inputs and outputs between your tool and other data models, experts, stakeholders etc.
* Clearly show the exchange of information between your tool and the IFC model. Which specific IFC classes are being checked or manipulated?

#### Energy Analysis Example
![Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timmcginley/41934/f21cac124069f9fdfd79cfc0cd5869d8746bf40c/Assignments/images/EnergyAnalysisBPMN_whole.svg) is a simple example of a diagram for an Energy Analysis use case.

![Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timmcginley/41934/main/Assignments/images/EnergyAnalysisComplexIDMdiagram.png) 
is a more complex [IDM](/Concepts/IDM) diagram of Energy Analysis.
  
### A2d: Scope the use case
* From the 'whole use case' identify where a new script / function / tool is needed. Highlight this in your BPMN diagram. Show this clearly in a new SVG diagram. You may wish to change the SVG diagram, you can use [inkscape] for this task.

### A2e: Tool Idea
* Describe in words your idea for your own OpenBIM ifcOpenShell Tool in Python.
* What is the [business and societal value] of your tool?
* Produce a [BPMN] diagram to summarise your idea. Save this in a folder in your repository along with an SVG of the disagram and embed the SVG in the [Markdown] as an image.
  
### A2f: Information Requirements
* Identify what information you need to extract from the model
     * Where is this in IFC?
     * Is it in the model?
     * Do you know how to get it in ifcOpenShell?
     * What will you need to learn to do this? **[Enrolled students only]:** [add to this excel in teams](https://dtudk.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/course215344/Delte%20dokumenter/General/Learning%20Bank.xlsx?d=w1436615b07ec4312af23ece1231635a2&csf=1&web=1&e=ZBDAPj)
 
### A2g: Identify appropriate software licence
* What [software licence] will you choose for your project?

See [this document](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/documents/IDM/IDM_guide-QuickGuideToBPMN-2007_01.pdf) and [this page](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/information-delivery-manual/) from buildingSMART for more information about creating [IDM](/Concepts/IDM) diagrams using BPMN.

## A2C: Define the SCOPE of your script
Using the diagram of your use case, identify the a part of it that you can execute in your script.
You can either clearly mark the part of the diagram from A2D that defines your scope or you can produce a new diagram.
Show the processes and logic of your tool in as much detail as possible (whithin reason). What information are you extracting and what happens with it throughout the script?

Focus on the early stage the larger use case, that is checking the model for information and either getting it ready for further simulations or maybe doing some simple calculations.

### 04.5 A BPMN diagram saved as SVG that defines the scope of your tool.
* Helps you to define the scope of your script

## Submission 2025
Enrolled students submit on DTU Learn [here](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/d2l/lms/dropbox/user/folders_list.d2l?ou=215344&isprv=0)

>Same procedure as last time

Please add an A2 folder into the root of your github repo. In that folder add a README.md with the information above and an IMG folder in the A2 folder that contains both your SVG and your BPMN.

You should submit a link in DTU Learn as a text file and a comment in the submission. 


### Learning Objectives

* 09 Identify and model a BIM use case based on the BIM challenges identified from analysis of an OpenBIM project in [BPMN].
* 10 Identify an appropriate [development methodology](/Concepts/Development_methodology) for an OpenBIM tool or model to different use cases.
* 12 Evaluate [software licensing](/Concepts/Software_licences/README.md) suitability and implications for the OpenBIM tool you develop or modelling tool you use.

<!-- OLD MODELLER ASSIGNMENT....

## A2A: Import the IFC model into BlenderBIM
* Import one of the Advanced Building Design Models into [BlenderBIM] and explore the IFC file and its properties.
### Optional: Add quantities to the IFC model
Skylab IFC models don't have quantities (Quantity Sets) defined for any of the elements. Quantity Sets define physical dimensions of objects like lenght, width, area and volume. Quantities are very important to have access to in a model and they are luckly easy to add to a model in BlenderBIM. Watch [this video](https://github.com/timmcginley/41934/blob/main/Concepts/BlenderBIM/AddQuantitiesToIfcModelInBlenderBIM/README.md) to see how to do it. Remember to save your modified IFC model and include it in your assignment submission. 
> N.B.: Please don't modify the IFC models in any other way or add any other information to them in this assignment. 
## A2B: Explore the model with scripts
* In the scripting window you can then use IfcOpenShell to further explore the model by following examples in the [tutorials](/Examples/IfcOpenShell/Basic).
## A3B Reflect
* Check the new numbers – using your scripts from the previous assignment
* Check your conformance to the BEP.
## A3B Remodel
Usecase: the Skylab-model (it is allowed to use other models, but they need to be IFC4 formatted)
Purpose: *modify, add* or *subtract* information in the model by using IfcOpenShell (You decide what modification is needed)

### Delivery
Requirements:
+ [x] **Markdown-formated report: Describing your tool/workflow: upload link to your Github report on Learn**
+ [X] **If you use the Skylab model please do NOT upload it at github**
+ [X] **If you use another .ifc model please upload in the folder structure at github as described in the beginning of the assignment**
      
The report should link to or include:
- [x] Two BPMN-diagrams
- [x] IFC model for the use case before the remodelling
- [x] IFC model for the use case after the remodelling
- [x] Description of and the script(s) used for the use case
