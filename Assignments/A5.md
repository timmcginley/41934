## Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
- Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended :

- What else do you still need to learn? 
- how you might use OpenBIM in the future?

## Your process of developing the tutorial
- Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
- Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
- Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

## (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial
- did the tool address the use case you identified?

## (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?

## (Individual) Wrap up
- conclude the journey through A1-A5

### Delivery

Requirements:
+ [x] **Markdown-formated report: Describing your Project Reflection: upload link to your Github report on Learn**
+ [X] **If you use the Skylab model please do NOT upload it at github**
+ [X] **If you use another .ifc model please upload in the folder structure at github as described in the beginning of the assignment**
      
Your delivery should tie together A3-A5 - And from a users/readers point of view we like to see dedicated references to each of the assignements' outcomes.
Therefore you may want to edit (commit changes to) the README.md in the main path of your project account to point at A3-A5 (A1-A2 is optional), or write a small intro to the Project Reflection and wrap-up that clearly links to each of the sub deliveries in those assignments. 

+ [x] Use github to upload A5 as a (or linked through) markdown formatted file

## Submission 2025
