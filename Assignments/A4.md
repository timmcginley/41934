| **Aim**|  Create a custom tutorial for your peers present and future  |
| **Tools** | Something you think they might need  |
| **Case** |  Identify and satisfy a learning need for you and / or your peers  |
| **Groups** | In your 2 - 3 people [focus] area groups |

| **Present** | Sign up for a Show & Tell place in either week [10], [11] or [12] |

_How can we learn from BIM at an organisational, insitutional and personal level?_

>This assignment is peer reviewed and also compulsory. Your reflection on the feedback from your peers will for part of your submission [A5]. In this way the emphasis in this assignment should be less 'what does the teacher want' and more 'what do my peers need'.

Through this experience we want to see you develop knoweldge transfer skills, that you could then apply in a professional environment. This assignment aims to address; how do we ‘learn from BIM’ at an organizational level? You will therefore have to consider how to teach what you have learnt in the process to another group of students. Ideally this would give students a chance to learn a concept they otherwise would not have time for in the course.

## Learning needs
1. In your [focus] groups your focus area managers will help you to gather the learning needs of your area.
2. Next you should agree in your focus area which groups will address which learning needs with a tutorial.
3. Learning objectives should be agreed for the tutorial, this is the responsibility of the teaching group, these should match the learning needs.
4. It is desirable to keep note the person or group that proposed the learning need as the 'owner' of that need, to assist the peer review process.

## Tutorial Format
Your tutorial could include at least 2 of the following:
||Format|Description|
|-|-|-|
|1|**Videos** | provide an easy way to follow you tutorial, but should be done with either markdown instructions or a jupyter notebook. Please include a permanant to your video from a hosting site like youtube if you want it to be available for others to learn from. If not it is also possible |
|2| **Jupyter Notebook**| More details [here](/Concepts/Jupyter)|
|3| **[Markdown](/Concepts/Markdown) README**| that includes markdown formatted code blocks for example code|


## Requirements
* Each group must present your tutorial to your focus area in one of the slot between week 9 and 12.
* Each group must provide feedback on a minimum of 2 other groups.
* Your reflection on your feedback will form part of you final submission [A5]
* Identification of [role] and [role learning level] that you are targeting 1,2 or 3. please check the different [roles] to see the levels.
* Address your specific [focus] area and BIM use.
* If using code, Ideally be written in Python, but can be other approaches in special cases if agreed with the course responsible.
* be tested by your peers.
* be reviewed and feedback provided by your peers to be submitted wuth [A5]
* A very brief summary (make an explicit summary section in your markdown):
    * A brief but descriptive title (5-10 words).
    * A brief summary/description (20-40 words).
    * This summary will be used on an overview page, featuring summaries and links for each group attending the course.

## Submission
* The tutorial, either as a github link or including your files, it should be possible to write the github link as a comment when you submit.

### Peer feedback session
Sign up for one of the time slots in weeks 10-12 (Sign up link available in week 9).

## Examples
In this assignment you will develop custom content that if you share publicly will be reused in future versions of the course. You will see examples from previous years below. In this way you support both your own learning and the future learning of others as part of our circular education system concept. We hope you find the examples below inspiring and that you want to also help other students. Can you see gaps in the current tutorials? What did you learn on the course that there was not already a good tutorial for that you want to share with others?
