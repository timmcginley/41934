<!-- 2025 update - are these the focus areas we need? -->


This course has been designed so that the emphasis is on learning _FROM_ BIM [(McGinley & Krijnen, 2021)]. We learn better studying things that interest us. What is your building engineering knowledge focus area?

1. [Architecture] / Fire evacuation / Acoustics / Mutliplayer
2. [Indoor] & Energy / Acoustic / Daylight
3. [Structure] inc. Structural Fire Safety
4. [Materials / LCA] / Materials / Sustainability Assessment
5. [Build] / Cost / Buildability / Permits


[Omrany, et. al, (2023)] provide an excellent overview on the literature for 7 themes of BIM use in the early design stages of tall buildings. In this course we have reduced this to 6 focus areas above that represent the areas of interest from previous versions of the course. They also link to subjects in [Advanced Building Design] and hopefully reflect areas of interest that you have for your specialisation tracks / study lines and or thesis subjects.
